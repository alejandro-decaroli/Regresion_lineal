# Simple and multiple linear regression

## This project consists of the application of linear regression of data from different datasets, to obtain the prediction of the desired target variable.

### Simple linear regression:

In the first example of the simple regression I worked with the Seaborn "Tips" dataset, this dataset contains data on: tip, bill total, sex, smoker and size, of a bar, I chose this dataset because it is very popular and simple to analyze.
In this case the variable I wanted to predict is "tips", so the first thing I did was analyze the dataset. I started by visualizing how the data is distributed, separating it by "sex" and "smoker", because I thought that by separating it this way I could obtain more information regarding how these variables interact with the others. I also made a correlation graph to take into account in the future.
From all this I concluded that the variables "sex" and "smoker" do not influence "tips", because there is no significant increase or decrease in "tips" generated by the variables.
According to the correlation graph "total_bill" is the variable that most influences "tips" so I decided to create the linear regression model posing how "total_bill" affects "tips".
In the graph you can see that there is a positive relationship between both and you can also see the prediction of the model.
